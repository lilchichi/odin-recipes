# Odin Recipes Design

This is the design portion, I've kept it seperate so things don't get too messy.

Below are rough sketches, I want to emphasize "rough sketches" before anyone mentions pixel perfect ðŸ˜… 
The designs consist of three main pages shown below: 

1) Home page

2) Recipes page with a filter option to sort through which categories of recipes you'd like to see

3) Recipe specific page which shows the chosen recipe
