      <li>1 unit(s) Red Onion</li>
      <li>30 grams Black Olives</li>
      <li>180 grams Penne Pasta (ContainsGluten)</li>
      <li>10 grams Vegetable Stock Paste (ContainsCelery)</li>
      <li>1 ball(s) Mozzarella (ContainsMilk)</li>
      <li>1 sachet Balsamic Vinegar (ContainsSulphites)</li>
      <li>2 unit(s) Garlic Clove</li>
      <li>15 grams Pine Nuts</li>
      <li>1 pack(s) Tomato Passata</li>
      <li>1 bunch(es) Chives</li>

      <li>100 milliliter(s) Water for the Sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat your oven to 200Â°C. Bring a large saucepan of water to the boil
        with 1/2 tsp salt for the pasta. Halve the tomatoes and pop them onto a
        piece of foil with a drizzle of oil and the balsamic vinegar, then
        season with salt and pepper. Fold the foil, sealing on all sides to
        create a parcel. When the oven is hot, roast on the top shelf until
        softened, 15-20 mins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, halve, peel and thinly slice the red onion. Peel and grate
        the garlic (or use a garlic press). Roughly chop the olives. Heat a
        large frying pan on medium heat (no oil). Once hot, add the pine nuts
        and dry-fry, stirring regularly, until lightly toasted, 2-3 mins. TIP:
        Watch them like a hawk as they can burn easily. Transfer to a small
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        When boiling, add the pasta to the water and bring back to the boil.
        Cook until tender, 12 mins. Once cooked, drain in a colander and pop
        back into the pan. Drizzle with oil and stir through to stop it sticking
        together.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the pasta cooks, pop your (now empty) frying pan back on medium
        heat with a drizzle of oil. Add the onion to your pan, then stir and
        cook until softened, 4-5 mins. Stir in the garlic and olives, then cook
        for 1 min more. Add the passata, water for the sauce, sugar (see
        ingredients for both amounts) and veg stock paste. Stir together, bring
        to a simmer, then cook until reduced by half, 5-7 mins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, finely chop the chives. Drain the mozzarella and pull it
        apart into small pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        When your sauce is ready, season to taste with salt and pepper, then add
        the cooked pasta and toss together. Stir through half the chives and
        half the torn mozzarella pieces. Serve the pasta in bowls with the slow
        roasted tomatoes spooned over the top, finished with the remaining
        mozzarella, chives and the pine nuts scattered over.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
